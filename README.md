# Flower_Classification

A clever machine learning model that can recognize 16 different types of flowers! It uses a special kind of artificial intelligence called a "Convolutional Neural Network" (CNN) to learn the unique features of each flower from pictures. <br />
Think of it like training a super gardener who can instantly tell apart daisies from daffodil!
